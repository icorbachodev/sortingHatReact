# Sorting Hat with React üé≤

This is the Technical Test I did for WITHMadrid.

It consists on the questions asked by the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter to Hogwarts students and assign them to the correct house.

With the questions they gave me I've coded a chat simulating it was the Sorting Hat evaluating you. All answers have house points that are added together. At the end, the final score decides which house you belong to.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
